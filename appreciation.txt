I give all thanks and glory to the Almighty God the giver of life and wisdom.

With him is everything possible.

He made this work a success , taking no dime or pinch of salt from me.

All who embrace him shall lack 'nothing'.

Before him only does my pride elude me and I spontaneously confess that he is the King for now and ever more.
Amen.
